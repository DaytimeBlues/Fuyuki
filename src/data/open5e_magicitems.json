When you use an action to present this scroll to an aberration whose Challenge Rating is equal to or less than your level, the binding powers of the scroll compel it to listen to you. You can then attempt to strike a bargain with the aberration, negotiating a service from it in exchange for a reward. The aberration is under no compulsion to strike the bargain; it is compelled only to parley long enough for you to present a bargain and allow for negotiations. If you or your allies attack or otherwise attempt to harm the aberration, the truce is broken, and the creature can act normally. If the aberration refuses the offer, it is free to take any actions it wishes. Should you and the aberration reach an agreement that is satisfactory to both parties, you must sign the agreement and have the aberration do likewise (or make its mark, if it has no form of writing). The writing on the scroll changes to reflect the terms of the agreement struck. The magic of the charter holds both you and the aberration to the agreement until its service is rendered and the reward paid, at which point the scroll blackens and crumbles to dust. An aberration's thinking is alien to most humanoids, and vaguely worded contracts may result in unintended consequences, as the creature may have different thoughts as to how to best meet the goal. If either party breaks the bargain, that creature immediately takes 10d6 psychic damage, and the charter is destroyed, ending the contract.","rarity":"rare","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"},{"slug":"absurdist-web-a5e","name":"Absurdist Web","type":"Wondrous Item","desc":"When you try to unfold this bed sheet-sized knot of spidersilk, you occasionally unearth a long-dead sparrow or a cricket that waves thanks before hopping away.

Full dissolution and distillation of an item's magical energy takes 1 hour, but 10 minutes is enough time to render most items nonmagical. If an item spends a full hour dissolving in the alembic, its magical energy coalesces in the smaller container as a lump of material resembling gray-purple, stiff dough known as arcanoplasm. This material is safe to handle and easy to incorporate into new magic items.

When the object lands, it transforms into a creature you determine by rolling a 1d8 and consulting the below table. The creature is a bramble version (see sidebar) of the beast listed in the table. The creature vanishes at the next dawn or when it is reduced to 0 hit points. The creature is friendly to you and your companions, and it acts on your turn. You can use a bonus action to command how the creature moves and what action it takes on its next turn, or give it general orders, such as to attack your enemies. In the absence of such orders, the creature acts in a fashion appropriate to its nature. Once three spiky objects have been pulled from the bag, the bag can't be used again until the next dawn. Alternatively, one willing animal companion or familiar can be placed in the bag for 1 week. A non-beast animal companion or familiar that is placed in the bag is treated as if it had been placed into a bag of holding and can be removed from the bag at any time. A beast animal companion or familiar disappears once placed in the bag, and the bag's magic is dormant until the week is up. At the end of the week, the animal companion or familiar exits the bag as a bramble creature (see the template in the sidebar) and can be returned to its original form only with a wish.

When the magic ritual completes, make an Intelligence (Arcana) check and consult the Terrain Changes table for the appropriate DCs. You can change the terrain in any one way listed at your result or lower. For example, if your result was 17, you could turn a small forest up to 30 feet across into a grassland, create a grove of trees up to 240 feet across, create a 6-foot-wide flowing stream, overgrow 1,500 feet of an existing road, or other similar option. Only natural terrain you can see can be affected; built structures, such as homes or castles, remain untouched, though roads and trails can be overgrown or hidden. On a failure, the terrain is unchanged. On a 1, an Overshadow (see Tome of Beasts 2) also appears and attacks you. On a 20, you can choose two options. Deities, Fey Lords and Ladies (see Tome of Beasts), archdevils, demon lords, and other powerful rulers in the Plane of Shadow can prevent these terrain modifications from happening in their presence or anywhere within their respective domains.

Despite its masterfully-crafted appearance, however, a cipher sword is uncomfortable to hold and strangely unwieldy. It has the two-handed and heavy properties and deals 2d8 slashing damage on a hit, but you feel this is only a fraction of its potential.\n\n_**Curse**_. There are other cipher swords owned by a variety of creatures across the planes. Most wielders consider themselves part of an exclusive group and expect the loyalty and cooperation of those with less mastery, regardless of other alliances. Attaining even a novice level of mastery attracts the attention of other wielders, who may have expectations of you.\n\nThe cipher sword also has the following properties:\n\n* You are not considered proficient with this weapon.\n* While wielding this weapon, you don’t benefit from any feature that would grant you additional attacks.\n\n**_Escalation._** This weapon is immensely powerful for those willing to solve the riddle of its use. Once per week, if you’ve successfully reduced a dangerous enemy (as determined by the Narrator) to 0 hit points with it since the last time you finished a long rest, make a DC 14 Intelligence check to meditate on the sword’s secrets. On a failure, you gain +1 to future attempts at this check. On a success, your level of mastery increases, you lose any bonus gained from failed attempts, the DC to advance again increases by 4, and the time between attempts increases by 1 week. If you ever willingly end your attunement to this weapon, you take 8 (4d4) psychic damage that cannot be negated or reduced and lose all mastery you’ve gained.\n\nThe levels of mastery are as follows:\n\n_Novice:_ You now are proficient with this weapon, and it gains the finesse property. However, wielding anything else begins to feel wrong to you, and you suffer _disadvantage_  on all melee weapon attacks made with a different weapon.\n\n_Apprentice:_ You gain +1 to _attack and damage rolls_ with this weapon. You can also now attack twice, instead of once, when you take the Attack action with this weapon on your turn. Additionally, you now suffer _disadvantage_  on all weapon attacks with other weapons.\n\n_Expert:_ Your bonus to _attack and damage rolls_  with this weapon increases to +2 and it gains the Vicious property. When you make a weapon attack with a different weapon, you now also take 4 (2d4) psychic damage. This damage cannot be negated or reduced by any means.\n\n_Master:_ Your bonus to _attack and damage rolls_ with this weapon increases to +3, and you can summon it to your hand as a bonus action so long as you are on the same plane as it. Additionally, once per _short rest_ , when you successfully attack a creature with it, you immediately learn about any special defenses or weaknesses that creature possesses as the blade imparts the wisdom of previous wielders. Additionally, the psychic damage you take from making a weapon attack with a different weapon increases to 8 (4d4).","rarity":"Very Rare","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"},{"slug":"circlet-of-blasting","name":"Circlet of Blasting","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"While wearing this circlet, you can use an action to cast the _scorching ray_ spell with it.

The work still influences the art of crafting magic items to this day. \n\n A regular copy of _Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things_ is a masterwork book about crafting magic items. Yet a fabled version of this tome is said to meander through literary circles—a copy annotated by a mad genius. Known as the _Crafter’s Codex_, this copy of the book is dog-eared throughout and stuffed to the brim with exceedingly peculiar, illegible marginalia. To the person approaching the book through the right means (such as refracting the text through a beer glass, reading at strange angles, or using one’s own personal genius) these notes reveal step-by-step instructions which streamline and improve the enchantments described within. Alas, no owner seems to hold on to the _Crafter’s Codex_ for long. The book itself appears to hyperfixate on a given reader and then simply disappear, presumably in search of someone more suited to its talents and disposition.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Crafter’s Codex_, a legendary book containing secrets of crafting magical items that can unsettle even the strongest minds.\n\n**DC 18** This book is a unique annotated version of the more common _Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things_.\n\n**DC 21** The Crafter’s Codex can only be destroyed by destroying every copy of _Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things_ that exists in the multiverse.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Crafter’s Codex_ has one lesser artifact benefit, one greater artifact benefit, and one greater artifact detriment. While attuned to this book, you gain an expertise die on any checks related to crafting a magic item, and you do not need to meet any of the usual requirements related to crafting a magic item aside from its cost.\n\nIn addition, you gain one random long-term mental stress effect oriented around inventing, the _Crafter’s Codex_, or keeping the book safely in your possession.\n\nOnce between _long rests_ , while crafting a magic item or performing an attendant activity towards crafting a magic item, you can consult the _Crafter’s Codex_ and make a DC 20 Intelligence check. On a success, choose one of the following:\n\n* Reduce research time by 75%.\n* Reduce component cost by 75%.\n* Reduce crafting time by 75%.\n* Reduce a harvesting DC by 6.\n* Reduce a crafting DC by 6.\n\nAfter three failures on the Intelligence check, th_e Crafter’s Codex_ moves on. You retain a copy of _Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things_ but the magic and marginalia of the _Crafter’s Codex_ magically transmits to a different copy somewhere else in the world, and you lose your attunement to it. Any bonuses accrued remain for the duration of the current crafting project or after a year and one day (whichever comes first). \n\n**Seekers of the Codex**\n\nThe _Crafter’s Codex_ is coveted by collectors and ambitious artificers alike, and any search for the Crafter’s Codex surely means encountering some of the following foes.\n\n__**Table: Seekers of the Codex**__\n| **1d6** | **Adversary**                                                         |\n| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1       | Noble with entourage of bodyguards—previous owner or antimagic zealot |\n| 2       | _Assassin_ , stealthy _mage_ , or _thief_                             |\n| 3       | Rival artificer (friendly or hostile)                                 |\n| 4       | Mischievous book-obsessed fey                                         |\n| 5       | Celestial or fiendish curator of an interplanar library               |\n| 6       | Rival artificer from an entirely different Material Plane             |\n\n**Destruction**\n\nThe secret knowledge that permeates the Crafter’s Codex cannot simply be stricken from the world with ink, blade, or fire. When the artifact faces a serious physical threat it simply moves on. The only way to rid the world of the _Crafter’s Codex_ is to eliminate every last copy of _Wands, Rings, and Wondrous Things_ that exists in the multiverse—if even one copy remains, even on another plane of existence, the _Crafter’s Codex_ persists.","rarity":"Artifact","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"},{"slug":"cravat-of-strangling-a5e","name":"Cravat of Strangling","type":"Wondrous Item","desc":"This red silk cravat appears to be—and, technically, is—extremely luxurious.

The heart can be attacked and destroyed (AC 11; hp 3; resistance to bludgeoning damage). If the heart is destroyed before the end if its duration, each creature within 30 feet of the heart must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened for 1 minute. This bugbear necromancer was once the henchman of an accomplished practitioner of the dark arts named Varrus. She started as a bodyguard and tough, but her keen intellect caught her master's attention. He eventually took her on as an apprentice. Moxug is fascinated with fear, and some say she doesn't eat but instead sustains herself on the terror of her victims. She eventually betrayed Varrus, sabotaging his attempt to become a lich, and luxuriated in his fear as he realized he would die rather than achieve immortality. According to rumor, the first craven's heart she crafted came from the body of her former master.","rarity":"uncommon","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"},{"slug":"crawling-cloak","name":"Crawling Cloak","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"This unusual cloak is made of many overlapping, broad strips of thick cloth.\nCrawling Cloak (Common).

Once worn by the monarch of an ancient crystal palace deep underground, the crown was lost after its wearer’s grasping schemes brought calamity on their people. The power, ambition, and ruthless might of the Crystal Sovereign of Coranaal still lingers, granting the wearer the following properties:\n\n_**Crystal Skin.**_ Your skin takes on a jagged, shimmering appearance and feels firm and cold to the touch. You gain +2 to your Armor Class. Additionally, when you’re hit by a ranged spell attack, roll 1d4\\. On a 3, you are unaffected and the spell is reflected back at its caster, rolling again to see if it hits.\n\n**_All-Seeing._** You gain truesight out to 30 feet. Additionally, you can use this trait to cast __clairvoyance_  at will, using the crown as your material component.\n\n**_Lord Under The Mountain._** Your Prestige Rating is increased by 2, or 4 if you’re underground.\n\n**_Regal Bearing._** A number of times per day equal to your Charisma modifier you can, as an action, target one creature that can see you within 60 feet. It must succeed on a Wisdom _saving throw_  (DC = 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Charisma modifier) or use its next turn to fall _prone_  in supplication, taking no other actions. Additionally, when you’re targeted with any attack by a creature within 10 feet of you, you can force it to make this saving throw as a reaction. On a failure it has _disadvantage_  on the attack and then falls prone as above.\n\n**_Greed of Coronaal._** It’s said that, even as their palace crumbled, the Crystal Sovereign still coveted and guarded their treasures. You can use an action to summon an item from the hoard of Coronaal, an endlessly enormous extra dimensional space that you can access remotely. You instinctively know what’s inside, and when you first access the hoard, roll on _Treasure_  for Challenge Ratings 23-30 to determine what’s already there. This doesn’t mean that you have any desire to share, however, and must make a DC 14 Wisdom _saving throw_  to willingly part, even temporarily, with any item that has been in the hoard.\n\nYou can also use an action to touch an item of up to Large size and send it to the hoard. However, the crown shuns items it deems unworthy, casting them into the Astral Plane if you attempt to store them. This includes magic items of common or uncommon rarity and any mundane items worth less than 500 gp. Additionally, as a security feature, creatures cannot enter this space; even the wearer can only access it remotely. Otherwise, the hoard has the limitations of any other interdimensional space in regards to Supply and dead creatures. Placing another interdimensional item, such as a _portable hole_ , in the hoard destroys the lesser item, scattering its contents across the Astral Plane. Additionally, 4 (2d4) random valuables from the horde are also lost in this way, though the crown of the crystal sovereign is otherwise unaffected.\n\n_**Curse.**_ When you attune to this crown, your _Destiny_  immediately changes to _Dominion_  if it’s not already, and you can only fulfill it by reclaiming the Crystal Palace of Coronaal, which is lost to time and overtaken by creatures from the depths. You lose any existing Destiny features. In addition, if you have a chance to advance this Destiny (as determined by the Narrator) and do not take it, you lose all benefits from the crown and suffer a level of _strife_  each week until you pursue the opportunity, at which point you lose all strife gained this way and regain the benefits of the crown. These levels of strife cannot otherwise be removed.\n\nThe crown remains firmly affixed to your head and cannot be removed in any way, nor can your attunement be broken, unless you are beheaded, at which point you can never attune to the item again, even if you are brought back to life. The only other exception is if you reclaim the Crystal Palace and then choose to, in the presence of 4 sentient creatures, formally renounce your title while sitting on the throne of Coronaal, at which point the palace and crown begin to crumble, ending your attunement and destroying the item.\n\n**_Escalation._** When you fulfill this destiny, the save DC of Regal Bearing and the Armor Class bonus of Crystal Skin increase by 2, while the range of your truesight increases by 60 ft, your Prestige bonus is increased by 2, and you can cast __scrying_  at will using the crown as a focus.","rarity":"Artifact","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"},{"slug":"crown-of-the-pharaoh","name":"Crown of the Pharaoh","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"The swirling gold bands of this crown recall the shape of desert dunes, and dozens of tiny emeralds, rubies, and sapphires nest among the skillfully forged curlicues.

You draw no more cards. \n\n","rarity":"legendary","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"wotc-srd","document__title":"5e Core Rules","document__url":"http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd"},{"slug":"deck-of-many-things-a5e","name":"Deck of Many Things","type":"Wondrous Item","desc":"A legend of ruination and wonder to those that have heard of it, the _Deck of Many Things_ is the fickle power of fate distilled. Most were created by gods of luck and are found in small and ornately carved coffers and have only 13 cards, but some have the full 22\\. The Narrator may decide, or roll 1d4 to determine randomly (a partial deck on a 1–3, or a full deck on a 4).\n\nBefore drawing, you must declare the number of cards that you intend to draw. A modified poker deck can be used to create your own physical deck using the substitutions below. A card's magic takes effect as soon as it is drawn. Once you begin drawing, each subsequent card must be drawn within an hour of the card that came before it. Failure to do so causes all of your remaining draws to fly out of the deck and take effect immediately. Once a card is drawn, if it is not a joker it is reshuffled into the deck, making it possible to draw the same card twice.\n\nOnce you have drawn the number of cards that you’ve declared, the deck resets and you may never draw from that deck again. Once all individuals present when the deck is discovered have drawn their cards, roll 1d4\\.

While your soul is trapped, your body is incapacitated. Even a _wish_ cannot restore your soul, but it can reveal its location. Any remaining draws from the deck are lost.\n\n♣ **Queen of Clubs: Flames.** You gain the enmity of a powerful devil. It seeks to destroy you along with all that you love or have built, inflicting as much misery upon you and your loved ones as possible before finally slaying you. This antagonism lasts until either you or the devil perish.\n\n♣ **Jack of Clubs: Skull.** A merciless harbinger of death appears and attempts to slay you. The harbinger appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet and immediately attacks. A sense of mortal dread fills any allies present, warning them to stay away. The harbinger fights until you die or it is reduced to 0 hit points. It cannot be harmed by anyone other than you, and if anyone other than you attempts to harm it, another harbinger of death is summoned for them.

You may use this ability immediately upon drawing the card or at any point prior to your death.\n\n♥ **King of Hearts: Throne.** You are granted proficiency in the Persuasion skill and gain a 1d6 expertise die on all Charisma (Persuasion) checks. You are also granted legal domain over a small keep or fortress on the plane that your character inhabits.

The weapon is chosen by the Narrator.\n\n♥ **Jack of Hearts: Knight.** A _veteran_  appears and offers you their service, believing it to be destiny, and will serve you loyalty unto death. You control this character.\n\n♥ **Two of Hearts: Gem.** You are showered in wealth. A total of 25 trinkets, easily portable pieces of art, or jewelry worth 2,000 gold each, or 50 gems worth 1,000 gold each appear directly in front of you. \n\n♠ **Ace of Spades: Donjon.** You vanish and are trapped in an extradimensional space. You are either unconscious in a sphere (50%) or trapped in a nightmare realm drawn from your own experiences and fears (50%). You remain in your prison until you are freed. While divination magics cannot locate you, a wish spell reveals the location of your prison. You cannot draw any more cards.\n\n♠ **King of Spades: Ruin.** All nonmagical wealth that you own is lost. Material items vanish. Property and other holdings are lost along with any documentation. You are destitute.\n\n♠ **Queen of Spades: Euryale.** You are _cursed_  by the card. You suffer a permanent –2 penalty to all _saving throws_ . Only a god or the Fates Card can end this curse.\n\n♠ **Jack of Spades: Rogue.** A trusted ally, friend, or other NPC (chosen by the Narrator) becomes a bitter enemy, although their identity is not revealed. They will act against you based upon their abilities and resources, and will try to utterly destroy you. Only a _wish_ spell or divine intervention can end the NPC’s hostility. \n\n♠ **Two of Spades: Balance.** Your history rewrites itself. You gain a randomly determined background, replacing your background feature with the new background feature. You do not change the skill proficiencies or ability score increases from your previous background, or gain new skill proficiencies or ability score increases.\n\n🃏 **Joker with Trademark: Fool.** You lose 10,000 xp and must immediately draw again. If the experience lost in this manner would cause you to lose a level, you are instead reduced to the beginning of your current level instead.\n\n🃏 **Joker without Trademark: Jester.** Fortune smiles on the foolish.

Long ago it was a desire to both bolster and renew their forces that led a mage to create a relic many would consider unthinkable: a scepter that twists the essence of life itself. With it the dead are remade into unrecognizable tangles of flesh that despite their deformity do the wielder of the scepter’s bidding, all as their allies are healed and empowered with vigor far beyond mortal bounds.\n\nThis heavy silver scepter has two heads, both cast in metal and staring out of glassy onyx eyes. One head is a skull, its jaw thrown open and its teeth unnaturally elongated. At the other end of the scepter is a cherubic human face that is turned upwards as though determined not to look at its sibling. \n\nNo one is certain whether it was the creator’s shame that led them to hide the scepter, or if their enemies cast it out of memory for fear of its power. What is known is that the legend of the _Dread Caduceus_ has endured and that whispers of its whereabouts have not been silenced by time.\n\nWhile you are attuned to the _Dread Caduceus_ you may use either end of the scepter to activate its powers.\n\n**Legends and Lore** Success on an Arcana or History check reveals the following:\n\n**DC 15** This is the _Dread Caduceus_, a holy scepter with the power to raise the dead. \n\n**DC 18** The cherub and skull heads cause healing and necromantic effects, respectively.\n\n**DC 21** Those who use the scepter risk having their very flesh corrupted and their souls devoured.\n\n**Artifact Properties**\n\nThe _Dread Caduceus_ has one lesser artifact benefit, one greater artifact benefit, one lesser artifact detriment, and one greater artifact detriment. \n\nThe _Dread Caduceus_ warps your life energy, twisting your flesh as it corrupts that of others. While you are attuned to the scepter, your organs shift and twist, sticking to one another within you. Take 1d6 necrotic damage each dawn from this effect. This damage can only be healed by a _long or short rest_ . You also have _disadvantage_  on initiative rolls as you are distracted by this tangible shifting within.\n\nThe _Dread Caduceus_ has 2d10 charges and regains 1d10 charges each dawn. When you reduce the _Dread Caduceus_ to 0 charges, you take 10d10 necrotic damage. If this damage reduces you to 0 hit points, you instantly die and cannot be resurrected (even by a _wish_  spell).\n\n**Cherub**\n\nYou can use an action and expend charges from the _Dread Caduceus_ to cause one of the following effects to extend from the cherub head of the scepter, targeting yourself or a creature within 30 feet: \n\n_**Heal.**_ The creature regains 1d8+1 hit points for each expended charge. \n\n**_Healing Nimbus (3 Charges)_**. A nimbus of healing appears around the creature for 1d6 rounds. For the duration, whenever the creature takes damage from an attack it regains 1 hit point, and when an attack misses the creature it regains 1d4 hit points.\n\n_**Invulnerability (3 Charges)**_. The creature becomes immune to damage from nonmagical attacks for 1d4 rounds.\n\n_**Exhaustless (5 Charges)**_. The creature becomes immune to _fatigue_  for 1d6 days.\n\n_**Resistance (5 Charges)**_. The creature becomes resistant to one type of damage of your choice for 1d6 rounds. This property has no effect if the creature already has resistance to that damage type.\n\n**_Cure (10 Charges)_**. The creature is healed of any _curses_ , _diseases_ , _poisons_ , or other negative effects, even if a _wish_  spell has previously been unsuccessful.\n\n_**Invigorate (10 Charges).**_ The creature permanently increases its maximum hit points by 1d8+1\\.

The creature gains the _skeleton template_  and remains under your control until you die or are no longer attuned to the _Dread Caduceus_. \n\n_**Animate Zombie (2 Charges).**_ You return a dead creature to a semblance of life, animating it as a zombie to serve at your whim. The creature gains the _zombie template_  and remains under your control until you die or are no longer attuned to the _Dread Caduceus._\n\n_**Empower Undead (2 Charges).**_ Choose 1d6 undead that you can see within range. Whenever one of the chosen undead makes a weapon attack it deals an extra 1d4 necrotic damage. Even on a miss, the undead deals 1d4 necrotic damage.\n\n**_Animate Legion (6 Charges)._** You return 3d10 dead humanoids to a semblance of life, transforming their corpses into _zombies_ . \n\nYou can use a bonus action to mentally command the undead you create using the _Dread Caduceus._ When you command multiple undead, you must give them all the same command.

If you are forthcoming with information the eye grows to trust you, but can be brought into conflict if you withhold any information.

Each object is always small enough to fit in a single hand and is never worth more than 1,000 gp. The GM determines the type and value of each object. Once the left eye of an ornate and magical statue of a pit fiend revered by a small cult of Mammon, this exquisite purple gem was pried from the idol by an adventurer named Slick Finnigan. Slick and his companions had taken it upon themselves to eradicate the cult, eager for the accolades they would receive for defeating an evil in the community. The loot they stood to gain didn't hurt either. After the assault, while his companions were busy chasing the fleeing members of the cult, Slick pocketed the gem, disfiguring the statue and weakening its power in the process. He was then attacked by a cultist who had managed to evade notice by the adventurers. Slick escaped with his life, and the gem, but was unable to acquire the second eye. Within days, the thief was finding himself assaulted by devils and cultists. He quickly offloaded his loot with a collection of merchants in town, including a jeweler who was looking for an exquisite stone to use in a piece commissioned by a local noble. Slick then set off with his pockets full of coin, happily leaving the devilish drama behind. This magical amulet attracts the attention of worshippers of Mammon, who can almost sense its presence and are eager to claim its power for themselves, though a few extremely devout members of the weakened cult wish to return the gem to its original place in the idol. Due to this, and a bit of bad luck, this amulet has changed hands many times over the decades.","rarity":"legendary","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"},{"slug":"eyes-of-charming","name":"Eyes of Charming","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"These crystal lenses fit over the eyes.

You can use an action to throw the token to a point within 10 feet of you. The token disappears, and a floating whip takes its place. You can then use a bonus action to make a melee spell attack against a creature within 10 feet of the whip, with an attack bonus of +9. On a hit, the target takes 1d6 + 5 force damage.\n\nAs a bonus action on your turn, you can direct the whip to fly up to 20 feet and repeat the attack against a creature within 10 feet of it. The whip disappears after 1 hour, when you use an action to dismiss it, or when you are incapacitated or die.","rarity":"rare","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"wotc-srd","document__title":"5e Core Rules","document__url":"http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd"},{"slug":"feather-token-a5e","name":"Feather Token","type":"Wondrous Item","desc":"This small silver charm resembles a feather.

The token transforms into a 50-foot long, 20-foot wide boat. The boat needs no propulsion and moves at a speed of 6 miles per hour, requiring no skill to operate. You can use an action to direct the boat to turn up to 90 degrees. Up to 32 medium creatures and their equipment can travel comfortably on the boat (Large creatures count as 4 creatures and Huge creatures count as 8 creatures). The boat remains for up to 24 hours before disappearing. You may spend an action to dismiss the boat. |\n| 36–50    | 1,000 gold | **Bird.** You can use an action to toss the token nearby where it transforms into a _roc_ . The bird obeys simple commands, though it will not attack, and can fly 16 miles an hour for up to 6 hours while carrying up to 500 pounds, or at half that speed while carrying up to 1,000 pounds.

While mounted on a ship, the figurehead’s magic affects the ship and every creature on the ship. A figurehead can be mounted on any ship larger than a rowboat, regardless if that ship sails the sea, the sky, rivers and lakes, or the sands of the desert. A ship can have only one figurehead mounted on it at a time. Most figureheads are always active, but some have properties that must be activated. To activate a figurehead’s special property, a creature must be at the helm of the ship, referred to below as the “pilot,” and must use an action to speak the figurehead’s command word. \nAlbatross (Uncommon). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the ship’s pilot can double its proficiency bonus with navigator’s tools when navigating the ship. In addition, the ship’s pilot doesn’t have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when peering through fog, rain, dust storms, or other natural phenomena that would ordinarily lightly obscure the pilot’s vision. \nBasilisk (Uncommon). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the ship’s AC increases by 2. \nDragon Turtle (Very Rare). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, each creature on the ship has resistance to fire damage, and the ship’s damage threshold increases by 5. If the ship doesn’t normally have a damage threshold, it gains a damage threshold of 5. \nKraken (Rare). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the pilot can animate all of the ship’s ropes. If a creature on the ship uses an animated rope while taking the grapple action, the creature has advantage on the check. Alternatively, the pilot can command the ropes to move as if being moved by a crew, allowing a ship to dock or a sailing ship to sail without a crew. The pilot can end this effect as a bonus action. When the ship’s ropes have been animated for a total of 10 minutes, the figurehead’s magic ceases to function until the next dawn. \nManta Ray (Rare). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the ship’s speed increases by half. For example, a ship with a speed of 4 miles per hour would have a speed of 6 miles per hour while this figurehead was mounted on it. \nNarwhal (Very Rare). While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, each creature on the ship has resistance to cold damage, and the ship can break through ice sheets without taking damage or needing to make a check. \nOctopus (Rare). This figurehead can be mounted only on ships designed for water travel. While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the pilot can force the ship to dive beneath the water. The ship moves at its normal speed while underwater, regardless of its normal method of locomotion. Each creature on the ship remains on the ship and can breathe normally as long as the creature starts and ends its turn in contact with the ship. The pilot can end this effect as a bonus action, causing the ship to resurface at a rate of 60 feet per round. When the ship has spent a total of 1 hour underwater, the figurehead’s magic ceases to function until the next dawn. \nSphinx (Legendary). This figurehead can be mounted only on a ship that isn’t designed for air travel. While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the pilot can command the ship to rise into the air. The ship moves at its normal speed while in the air, regardless of its normal method of locomotion. Each creature on the ship remains on the ship as long as the creature starts and ends its turn in contact with the ship. The pilot can end this effect as a bonus action, causing the ship to descend at a rate of 60 feet per round until it reaches land or water. When the ship has spent a total of 8 hours in the sky, the figurehead’s magic ceases to function until the next dawn. \nXorn (Very Rare). This figurehead can be mounted only on a ship designed for land travel. While this figurehead is mounted on a ship, the pilot can force the ship to burrow into the earth. The ship moves at its normal speed while burrowing, regardless of its normal method of locomotion. The ship can burrow through nonmagical, unworked sand, mud, earth, and stone, and it doesn’t disturb the material it moves through. Each creature on the ship remains on the ship and can breathe normally as long as the creature starts and ends its turn in contact with the ship.

Each goat looks unique and functions differently from the others. Their properties are as follows:\n\n* The _goat of traveling_ can become a Large goat with the same statistics as a riding horse. It has 24 charges, and each hour or portion thereof it spends in beast form costs 1 charge. While it has charges, you can use it as often as you wish. When it runs out of charges, it reverts to a figurine and can't be used again until 7 days have passed, when it regains all its charges.\n* The _goat of travail_ becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. Once it has been used, it can't be used again until 30 days have passed.\n* The _goat of terror_ becomes a giant goat for up to 3 hours. The goat can't attack, but you can remove its horns and use them as weapons. One horn becomes a _+1 lance_, and the other becomes a _+2 longsword_. Removing a horn requires an action, and the weapons disappear and the horns return when the goat reverts to figurine form. In addition, the goat radiates a 30-foot-radius aura of terror while you are riding it. Any creature hostile to you that starts its turn in the aura must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the goat for 1 minute, or until the goat reverts to figurine form. The frightened creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

If the chosen space is occupied (either by creatures or non-living obstacles) the figurine does not transform.\n\nThe resulting creature is friendly to you and your companions, with a notable exception listed below. It understands any language you can speak and follows your verbal commands. When not carrying out a task, the creature defends itself but does not otherwise act.\n\nEach creature stays transformed for a specific duration, detailed in its individual entry. At the end of this duration, the creature turns back to its inanimate form. It also reverts early if it drops to 0 hit points or if you use an action to speak the command word while touching it. Once it has reverted to its figurine form, it cannot transform again for a duration specific to each creature, as detailed in its entry.\n\n---\n\n__**Table: Figurine of Wondrous Power**__\n| **Figurine**           | **Rarity** | **Cost**  | **Crafting Components**                   | **Property**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ---------------------- | ---------- | --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Bronze Griffin**     | Rare       | 5,000 gp  | Griffon feather                           | This bronze figurine is of a griffon in an aggressive posture.

Odin thrust the sword it into a tree and proclaimed that anyone who pulled it from the tree would receive the sword itself as a gift, and that none had ever borne a finer blade. Sigmund drew it, only for Odin to eventually break the blade after he had used it in several battles. The two halves were bequeathed to his son, Sigurd.\n\n_Gram_ was reforged by the dwarf Regin for Sigurd in order to slay Regin’s brother, the wizard-turned-dragon, Fafnir, and reclaim a cursed treasure. Sigurd proofed the blade on Regin’s own anvil, breaking the blade again, and then again after a second forging. Finally, on the third time, it split the anvil in half with a single stroke. Sigurd later killed Fafnir by hiding in a ditch and thrusting upwards into the drake’s unprotected belly. The ditch carried away most of the dragon’s burning, poisonous blood but _Gram_, as well as Sigrud’s arm up to the shoulder, were bathed in it, and a portion of that venomous malice remains in the sword. Though Sigurd’s eventual tragic end had more to do with a cursed ring he stole from the dragon’s hoard than _Gram_, it is nevertheless known as the Sword of Grief.","rarity":"Legendary","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"},{"slug":"granny-wax","name":"Granny Wax","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"Normally found in a small glass jar containing 1d3 doses, this foul-smelling, greasy yellow substance is made by hags in accordance with an age-old secret recipe.

If the quiver is destroyed, its contents are lost forever, although an artifact always turns up again somewhere. If a breathing creature is placed within the quiver, the creature can survive for up to 5 minutes, after which time it begins to suffocate. Placing the quiver inside an extradimensional space created by a bag of holding, handy haversack, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it and deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane. The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.","rarity":"common","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"},{"slug":"hangmans-noose","name":"Hangman's Noose","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"Certain hemp ropes used in the execution of final justice can affect those beyond the reach of normal magics.

It has the following additional properties. \n\n_**Red Reaping.**_ Whenever you use _Harvest_ to reduce a living creature to 0 hit points, it absorbs that creature’s soul and stores it within. _Harvest_ cannot store more than one soul in this way and the souls of any creatures you reduce to 0 hit points while a creature’s soul is already contained within it are not affected by this property.\n\n_**Sow the Reaped.**_ You can use an action to strike the ground with the sickle and produce a blood clone using a creature’s soul stored within _Harvest._ This blood clone appears in an unoccupied space adjacent to you and uses the statistics the creature had when it was alive, except it is both ooze and undead in addition to its other types. Blood clones formed in this way act immediately after you in initiative, and they obey your verbal commands to the best of their ability. Without such commands, the blood clone only defends itself. Once formed, a blood clone remains until destroyed or until 10 minutes pass, after which it dissolves into rotten offal and the trapped soul travels to whatever afterlife was intended for it.\n\n_**Only Life May Die.** Harvest_ has no effect on unliving creatures, and passes harmlessly through constructs and undead when it is used to attack them. \n\n_**Sentience.** Harvest_ is a sentient weapon with Intelligence 14, Wisdom 18, and Charisma 17\\. It sees and hears using your senses. _Harvest_ communicates with only you telepathically and can read, speak, and understand Common, Halfling, and Orc. It cannot communicate with a creature it is not attuned to.\n\n_**Personality.**_ This sickle originally had a much more benign purpose, created by a halfling archdruid to bring forth a new plant for each one harvested. When its creator was killed by an orcish warchief it became a weapon, and in her hands it grew to find a new purpose. It eventually convinced its bearer to sow what she reaped, and caused the very spirit and blood of those she had cut down to slaughter its orcish captors. _Harvest_ has come to believe that all people are inherently wicked and deserve death. It believes that real peace can only be achieved when the last mind capable of war and cruelty goes silent, leaving nothing but the plants and beasts. _Harvest_ tolerates people with a connection to nature but only if they are regularly giving it a chance to continue its “culling”. It whispers often of its great work, and begs you to enrich the earth’s soil with blood that it spills. If you go more than 3 days without using Harvest to slay a sentient creature, you’ll be in conflict with _Harvest_. When in conflict, any time you use the Sow the Reaped property the resulting blood clone ignores your verbal orders and attacks you to the best of its ability. If you are killed by the blood clone in this way, your soul is absorbed into _Harvest_. \n\n_**Destroying Harvest.**_ _Harvest_ is unbreakable but a person that has mastered nature can unmake it. With 24 hours worth of ritual work, any 20th level druid can deconstruct the weapon and return its tortured mind to the earth it was formed from, rendering _Harvest_ an inert mundane sickle made with a moonstone blade.","rarity":"Legendary","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"},{"slug":"hat-of-disguise","name":"Hat of Disguise","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"While wearing this hat, you can use an action to cast the _disguise self_ spell from it at will.

This radiant indigo prism encases a pearl and can store spells for later use. The stone can hold up to 3 spell levels and is typically found with 1d4 – 1 levels of stored spells. To store a spell in the stone, a creature must cast a 1st-, 2nd-, or 3rd-level spell while holding it. The spell is drawn into the stone with no other effect.

The firework sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Invisible creatures and objects are visible as long as they are in the firework’s bright light.\n Priest Light (Rare). This silver cylinder firework produces a tall, argent flame and numerous golden sparks for 10 minutes. The flame appears on the round after you throw it. The firework sheds bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. An undead creature can’t willingly enter the firework’s bright light by nonmagical means. If the undead creature tries to use teleportation or similar interplanar travel to do so, it must first succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. If an undead creature is in the bright light when it appears, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be compelled to leave the bright light. It won’t move into any obviously deadly hazard, such as a fire or pit, but it will provoke opportunity attacks to move out of the bright light. In addition, each non-undead creature in the bright light can’t be charmed, frightened, or possessed by an undead creature.\n Red Dragon’s Breath (Very Rare). This firework is wrapped in gold leaf and inscribed with scarlet runes, and it erupts into a vertical column of fire on impact. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius, 60-foot-high cylinder centered on the point of impact must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 10d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.\n Snake Fountain (Rare). This short, wide cylinder is red, yellow, and black with a scale motif, and it produces snakes made of ash for 1 minute. It starts producing snakes on the round after you throw it. The firework creates 1 poisonous snake each round. The snakes are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the snakes as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don’t issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions. The snakes remain for 10 minutes, until you dismiss them as a bonus action, or until they are doused with at least 1 gallon of water.","rarity":"varies","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"},{"slug":"kraken-clutch-ring","name":"Kraken Clutch Ring","type":"Ring","desc":"This green copper ring is etched with the image of a kraken with splayed tentacles.

Some historians believe its translation ends with ‘wounding wand’ while others claim it is ‘wounding twig’, similar to the word for magic staff (gambantein). Either way it is this weapon and this weapon only that can kill the golden rooster Víðópnir (which sits in the branches of Yggdrasil and may be tied to Ragnarök, or possibly be another name for Gullinkambi) so that its wing joints (the only things that will suffice) can be used to distract the dogs guarding the flame-encircled castle holding Menglöð, a maiden fated to be married to the hero Svipdagr. The runed weapon awaits within however, protected by the jötunn Sinmara (a _storm giant_ ) who will only exchange it for a tail feather from the golden rooster—that can only be harmed by the very same sword, creating a paradoxical task. Its forger and the owner of the chest that contains it can reveal the secrets to bypassing the 9 locks holding its prison closed, although Loki would only ever do so if a cunning price is attached...\n\nLÆVATEINN\n\nUntil you are attuned to this staff, it appears to be a rotting quarterstaff or battered longsword. After you have attuned to it however, runes glow along the length of the wood or the blade.\n\nThis staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. While wielding it, you can use a bonus action to transform it into a magic longsword or back.\n\nThe staff has 10 charges for the following properties. It regains 1d8+4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20\\. On a 1, the staff loses its properties and becomes a nonmagical weapon (whichever form it is in when the last charge is expended).\n\nWhile it is in staff form, the runes grant access to magic.\n\n_**Spell Runes.**_ You can use an action to expend 1 or more of the staff’s charges to activate a rune and cast one of the following spells from it (spell save DC 18, +10 to hit with spell attacks): __hideous laughter_  (1 charge), _speak with animals_  (1 charge), _pass without trace_  (2 charges), _dispel magic_  (3 charges), _speak with plants_  (3 charges), __confusion_  (4 charges), __glibness_  (8 charges). You can also use an action to cast the __charm person , disguise self ,_ or __vicious mockery_  spells from the staff without using any charges.\n\nWhile it is in longsword form, the runes channel magic with less finesse and unleash lethal energies.\n\n_**Death Rune.**_ You can use a bonus action and 1 charge to activate this rune, causing shadows to flow out from the weapon for 1 minute. These shadows reduce _dim light_  in a 40-foot radius to _darkness_ , and bright light in a 20-foot radius to dim light. While the weapon is shadowed, it deals an extra 2d6 necrotic damage to any target it hits. The shadows last until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again, the duration expires, or until you drop the weapon.\n\n_**Flame Rune.**_ You can use a bonus action and 1 charge to activate this rune, causing flames to erupt from the weapon for 1 minute.

Along the top there is a hidden catch, which can be found with a successful DC 23 Intelligence (Investigation) check. Releasing the catch unlocks a hatch revealing a cylinder wide enough for a Medium creature to crawl inside. The _Nautilus_ is a Gargantuan object with the following statistics:\n\n**Armor Class:** 25  \n**Hit Points:** 400 (damage threshold 20)  \n**Speed** swim 200 ft. (can turn a maximum of 15 degrees in a round)  \n**Damage Immunities** poison, psychic  \n**Crew Capacity** 25; **Passenger Capacity** 600  \n**Travel Pace** 58 miles per hour (460 miles per day)\n\nTo be used as a vehicle, the _Nautilus_ requires one pilot at the helm. While the hatch is closed, the compartment is airtight and watertight.\n\nThe steel submarine holds enough air for 15,000 hours of breathing, divided by the number of breathing creatures inside (at most 625 for 24 hours). There are 2 decks of interior compartments, most of which are 6 feet high. Interior doors are airtight, have AC 20 and 50 hit points, and can be bypassed with DC 18 Dexterity (thieves’ tools) checks or DC 25 Strength checks.\n\nThe _Nautilus_ floats on water. It can also go underwater to a depth of 9,000 feet. Below that, the vehicle takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage per minute from pressure.\n\nA creature at the helm can use an action to pilot the _Nautilus_ by making a DC 18 Intelligence (vehicle \\[water\\]) check, with disadvantage if there are no other creatures controlling the ballasts, hydraulics, and sensors (each an action), or with _advantage_  if each position has a creature helping. On a success, the pilot can double the effects of any acceleration, deceleration, or turning they make with the _Nautilus_ on their turn. In addition, the pilot can send the submarine careening into a creature or object, making an attack roll as usual.\n\n_**Prow.** Melee Weapon Attack:_ +12 to hit, reach 20 ft., one target. _Hit:_ 34 (8d6+6) piercing damage. On a natural 1, the Nautilus takes 34 (8d6+6) bludgeoning damage.\n\nAny creature in the command room can pull a lever to activate its function, but the _Nautilus_ only responds to the first 8 levers pulled in a round, and a lever only performs a function once per round. While traveling forward the lever to travel backwards does not function, and while traveling backward the level to travel forwards does not function. After each use, a lever goes back to its neutral position.\n\n__Nautilus Controls__\n| Lever | Up                                                                                                                                                              | Down                                                                        |\n| ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| 1     | Forward window shutter opens.                                                                                                                                   | Forward window shutter closes.                                              |\n| 2     | Side window shutters open (20 per side).                                                                                                                        | Side window shutters close (20 per side).                                   |\n| 3     | Two manipulator arms extend from the front of the Nautilus.                                                                                                     | The manipulator arms retract.                                               |\n| 4     | Each extended manipulator arm makes the following _melee weapon attack_: +12 to hit, reach 15 ft., one target. _Hit_: The target is _grappled_  (escape DC 20). | One or both extended manipulator arms release what they are holding.        |\n| 5     | The _Nautilus_ accelerates forward, increasing its speed by 20 feet (to a maximum of 200 feet).                                                                 | The _Nautilus_ decelerates, reducing its speed by 50 feet (minimum 0 feet). |\n| 6     | The _Nautilus_ accelerates backward, increasing its speed by 20 feet (to a maximum of 200 feet).                                                                | The _Nautilus_ decelerates, reducing its speed by 50 feet (minimum 0 feet). |\n| 7     | The _Nautilus_ turns 15 degrees left.                                                                                                                           | The _Nautilus_ turns 15 degrees right.                                      |\n| 8     | Eyelike fixtures emit bright light in a 300-foot radius and dim light for an additional 150 feet.                                                               | The light turns off.                                                        |\n| 9     | The _Nautilus_ sinks as much as 50 feet in liquid.                                                                                                              | The _Nautilus_ rises up to 50 feet in liquid.                               |\n| 10    | The top hatch unseals and opens.                                                                                                                                | The top hatch closes and seals.                                             |","rarity":"Artifact","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"},{"slug":"necklace-of-adaptation","name":"Necklace of Adaptation","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"While wearing this necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment, and you have advantage on saving throws made against harmful gases and vapors (such as _cloudkill_ and _stinking cloud_ effects, inhaled poisons, and the breath weapons of some dragons).","rarity":"uncommon","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"wotc-srd","document__title":"5e Core Rules","document__url":"http://dnd.wizards.com/articles/features/systems-reference-document-srd"},{"slug":"necklace-of-adaptation-a5e","name":"Necklace of Adaptation","type":"Wondrous Item","desc":"While wearing this finely-woven necklace, you can breathe normally in any environment and you have _advantage_  on _saving throws_  made against harmful gases, vapors, and other inhaled effects.","rarity":"Uncommon","requires_attunement":"requires attunement","document__slug":"a5e","document__title":"Level Up Advanced 5e","document__url":"https://a5esrd.com/a5esrd"},{"slug":"necklace-of-fireballs","name":"Necklace of Fireballs","type":"Wondrous item","desc":"This necklace has 1d6 + 3 beads hanging from it.

Typically, the pole is driven into the ground or wedged into a rocky cleft in a remote spot where the intended victim won't see it until it's too late. The pole is created to punish a specific person for a specific crime. The exact target must be named on the pole; a generic identity such as “the person who blinded Lars Gustafson” isn't precise enough. The moment the named target approaches within 333 feet, the pole casts bestow curse (with a range of 333 feet instead of touch) on the target. The DC for the target's Wisdom saving throw is 15. If the saving throw is successful, the pole recasts the spell at the end of each round until the saving throw fails, the target retreats out of range, or the pole is destroyed. Anyone other than the pole's creator who tries to destroy or knock down the pole is also targeted by a bestow curse spell, but only once. The effect of the curse is set when the pole is created, and the curse lasts 8 hours without requiring concentration. The pole becomes nonmagical once it has laid its curse on its intended target.

When the world seemed doomed, powerful wizards came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five _Orbs of Dragonkind_ (or _Dragon Orbs_) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five wizard towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.\n\nAs the wizard towers fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.\n\nEach orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.\n\nAn orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.\n\nWhile attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word.

Each creature in the gas can hear only sounds originating within 5 feet of it, and creatures outside of the gas can’t hear sounds originating inside the gas. The gas lasts for 5 minutes or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it. Explosive Orb of Obfuscation (Rare).

In addition to the effects of that gas, this orb also releases a burst of caustic chemicals on impact. Each creature within a 15-foot radius of where the orb landed must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw, taking 4d4 acid damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. If a creature fails this saving throw, the chemicals cling to it for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 2d4 acid damage from the clinging chemicals. Any creature can take an action to remove the clinging chemicals with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Medicine) check.","rarity":"varies","requires_attunement":"","document__slug":"vom","document__title":"Vault of Magic","document__url":"https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/vault-of-magic-for-5th-edition/"},{"slug":"orb-of-the-dragon-breaker-a5e","name":"Orb of the Dragon Breaker","type":"Wondrous Item","desc":"This iridescent glass sphere resembles a soap bubble tinted the color of the dragon scale used to create it.
