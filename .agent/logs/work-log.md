## 2026-01-09 [Aramancia] - Morphic System Implementation
- Implemented Morphic Programming system for agent-assisted development
- Created core files: `AGENT.md`, commands (prime, cleanup, abstract, build-feature)
- Established context structure: system preferences, project-specific context
- Set up logging infrastructure

**Key Decisions:**
- Integrated Morphic System into existing `.agent/` folder
- Preserved existing `GEMINI.md` and `workflows/` for backward compatibility
- Structured for multi-project support (future: math-omni, dictaphone)

→ Next: Test the system by running `/prime-agent aramancia`
